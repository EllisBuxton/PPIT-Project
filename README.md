# Genetic Algorithm Melody Generator 

This project is a melody generator implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) in Python. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of melodies over generations to produce new melodies that fit certain criteria. This implementation is designed to run on Google Colab, utilizing the Pyo library for audio synthesis.

## Overview

The genetic algorithm works by creating an initial population of melodies represented as sequences of musical notes. These melodies are then evaluated based on certain criteria, such as melody fitness, harmony, and rhythm. The fittest melodies are selected to produce offspring through crossover and mutation operations. This process is repeated over multiple generations, gradually improving the melodies in the population.


## Usage

- Open the notebook file (genetic_melody_generator.ipynb) in Google Colab.
- Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the genetic algorithm.
- Once the algorithm finishes, you can listen to the generated melodies.

  ## Example Output

  After running the genetic algorithm, you will get MIDI files or audio files containing the generated melodies. You can listen to these melodies and analyze their quality.
